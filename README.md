## Insight

I just spent the last week consumed in Next.js lectures and tutorials garnering further insight into this extremely powerful platform.  I am a huge fan of the speed and revolutionary, out-of-the-box features it provides.  I also love that it's built on React which is dope.  I really love the built it page paridigm routing.  The SEO feature is great as well as the built in API.  You can actually build an entire CRUD app without a server, within Next.js!  I am in love.  

## Getting Started
